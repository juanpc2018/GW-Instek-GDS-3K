# GW-Instek-GDS-3K 

GW Instek GDS-3000 series, hase 2 groups... </br>
from 150Mhz to 350Mhz with 5GSa/s and 500MHz with 4GSa/s, </br>
the 500MHz has a different HW, different Firmware. </br>

this is only for the 150MHz to 350MHz range, Non-A models, "The Original", </br>

Problem: </br>
has SVGA DB15 output, 800x600 BUT... Non-Standard 59fps, </br>
the 500MHz model has same screm, maybe has same problem, Unknown. </br>

59fps makes VGA output 100% incompatible with most VGA to HDMI converters, </br>
requires a DSP Scaler, most monitors with VGA input have enough DSP to adapt, </br>
but cheap converters Do Not. </br>

i tested many cheap & hi quality converters without Scaler, None worked. </br>

Works: </br>
Kramer VP-728 FW 1.29 </br>

Should work: </br>
Kramer VP-729 </br>

Maybe work: </br>
Kramer older models: VP-718 719 720 724 xl </br>
AudioAuthority 1366 </br>
Startech VGA2HDMI "AudioAuthority Rebrad" </br>
Micomsoft XPC-4 </br>
maybe others... </br>

Does Not Work: </br>
Kramer Vp-22 "Analog Converter" </br>

Kramer VP-728 does Not have enough DSP to do Digital PIP </br>
VGA + HDMI sadly. </br>
Only Analog Universal Inputs+VGA *see manual. </br>
HDMI Embedded Audio does Not work at 1920x1080 nor 1920x1200 with MacMini 2014. </br>
manual say: does Not work with 1920x1080 but works with 1080p or Native </br>
None Worked here. </br>
Advantage: VP-728 has Detail Enhancement and Chroma Enhancer </br>
both settings at Low, increase quality of HDMI 1080p signals drastically on Smart TVs. </br>
Looking YouTube Videos feels like watching 444 instead of 422. </br>
Opera Browser has a Lucid Mode similar to Detail Enhacement, but needs too much CPU. </br>
DSP is much more efficient. </br>

Also has multiple inputs, works as a Switcher. </br>
good for Monitors that only have 1 HDMI input, and No VGA input. </br>

Max Resolution 1920x1200x60 </br>
some features do Not work at High Resolution *Read Manual. </br>

Acceptable: </br>
has a small 1U 12v fan, tolerable, Not as loud / noisy as others, Ok. </br>
fanless modification with bigger heatsinks would be nice. </br>
